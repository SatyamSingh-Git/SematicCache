I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though. As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud). The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate). The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created in His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about Jesus as a person.

Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack environmentalism) A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie. A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light. Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something other than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the health of future generations is based. It is being treated with respect. You think he's going to happily leave it at that? No. When one error is rejected, it is his style to push people to the opposite error. Therefore the earth is not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is God. Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve. I see two facets of a response to it: 1: Care for the environment. Treat it with proper respect, both because it is God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not constitute what the Apostle Paul called \"becoming all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some.\" Don't say \"Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time on.\" - putting your foot in your", "vector_score": 0.08092469722032547, "bm25_score": 0.8544259931003154, "overlap_score": 0.75, "matched_keywords": ["what", "a", "is"], "explanation": "Matched with 75% keyword overlap (what, a, is).", "rerank_score": -8.311059951782227}, {"id": 4, "score": -8.552093505859375, "filename": "newsgroup_11.txt", "content": "very little about Jesus as a person.

Revelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse. This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness. No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\" to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it?

Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch! It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game. Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful.

Hence big cooling towers. Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient. Some plants do cool the condensers with water, rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".

Furthermore, its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far as it goes. However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap \"terrorists and drug dealers\" is to restrict stronger techniques. Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or (the vast majority) no encryption. The latter two classes can be tapped. With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption class is merged into the weak-encryption class. Will the introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy to give up on it? that is, to rely for privacy on a system expressly designed to deny it to people like them? I doubt it. The mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*. The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic cryptography, and only by this restriction. \"Clipper\" appears to be no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints. We would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public at large will not care. I hate to even mention gun control, but most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT. I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car. Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two. I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche. The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car. It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way. I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car. \"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer. Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account. \"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double. And if you go", "vector_score": 0.11477154493331909, "bm25_score": 0.0, "overlap_score": 0.0, "matched_keywords": [], "explanation": "Matched with 0% keyword overlap ().", "rerank_score": -9.742412567138672}, {"id": 21, "score": -9.763561248779297, "filename": "newsgroup_2.txt", "content": "well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after starting life as a 512k way back in 1985. sooo, i'm in the market for a new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be... i'm looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch of questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer: * does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook introductions are expected? i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an appearence \"this summer\" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i don't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had more info... * has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the ones the duo's just went through recently? * what's the impression of the display on the 180? i could probably swing a 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have a feel for how much \"better\" the display is (yea, it looks great in the store, but is that all \"wow\" or is it really that good?). could i solicit some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?
